# Lesson 8: Take the easy way out
Remember back to when we used `Scanner.nextLine()` to read input?\
What we did then was use an existing method that is part of the `Scanner` class
 - Methods are just chunks of code that belong to a class and serve a particular purpose (e.g. reading keyboard input)
 - The `.nextLine()` method is just code someone else wrote and we can use. Sharing is caring &nbsp; :heart: 
The kind folks that provide this lovely, free code are at a company called Oracle.\
They provide all sorts of helpful hints and tutorials [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html)

### Method practice: `String`s
Here are a few useful built-in methods for use on strings &nbsp;:arrow_down:
  1. `String.length()` returns the number of letters in a string
  2. `String.chatAt(0)` returns the first letter in a string
    - :pushpin:&nbsp; The `0` above is the **index** of a character in a string
      - The index of a `String` always starts at 0.
  3. `String.concat()` allows us to combine two `String`s into one
    - We can also use the addition operator like this: `String myCombinationString = "hello"` + `"world"`
  4. `String.substring(startIndex, endIndex)` will create a smaller string based on the index specified
